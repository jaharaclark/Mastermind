# DTR: Define the Relationship

### Template for DTR Memo

*Group Member Names:* Andrew || Jahara

*Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):*
Andrew: 
 - passing grade
 - adequate time driving
 - good partner working relationship
Jahara:
 - passing grade
 - some independent time : lets say we agree that there needs to be XYZ piece of functionality. Maybe we take 30min to work on it ourselves, the come back, talk through our code and implement the best pieces together
 
** Work together to be able to craft together, simultaneously. Have good discussions over code together, use Tuple, teletype, Zoom annotate, etc.
	
*Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):*
We talked about how to drive/nagivate together. It seems like we have a good understanding of how to both make sure we're getting learning while being good project partners.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
Andrew:
 - we can take a few minutes to stop and break problems into managable pieces
 
Jahara:
 - creating a road map and allocating appropriate time to accomplish tasks 
 - keeping documentation and files, etc nice and pretty 
 
Outside help?
 - everyone understanding every bit of code is important
 - copying someone elses code is a hard no, but collaborating with others is acceptable as long as both partners are communicating about it
 - rocks, mentors are great! work on a different branch without side help, come back together and rework through it together to make sure everyone understands.

*Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):*
We put calendar times on the calendar and will reassess progress on Saturday.

*Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):*
We exchanged phone numbers understanding that life gets complicated; we're going to try to keep most of the communication during "regular business hours" but that doesn't always happen. 

*Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):*
We're striving to have the knowledge to complete the "advanced" iteration of 8 characters and 6 colors, even if we don't write the code to that level.

*Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):*
There aren't exact feature expectations, but we're each going to make a list of the things that are expected for the project and the order they need to be done. 

*Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):*
See above

*Pomodoro Break Schedule:*
30 - 45 minutes on and like 10 - 15 minute

*Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:*
Make it actionable, be kind, give it in a timely manner.

*Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):*
It's just the two of us, we may not need a full blown project management tool at this stage of our development.
